      <p>At Rosebank College, leadership goes beyond the classroom. Our students continue to shine as community leaders, dedicating their time and energy to uplift those around them. From organising charity drives and food donations to volunteering at local shelters and schools, Rosebank students are proving that true success is not only about personal achievement, but also about giving back.

        These initiatives not only impact the community positively but also inspire fellow students to embrace compassion, teamwork, and social responsibility. Rosebank is proud to celebrate these young leaders who embody the spirit of service and remind us all that small actions can create big change.</p>
