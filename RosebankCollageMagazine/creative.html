  <h2>Poem: The Journey Begins.</h2>
  <sub>by Nqobile Manqoba - (Student at Rosebank Collage)</sub>

  <p>New halls, new faces, the story starts,</p>

  <p>A thousand dreams, a thousand hearts.</p>

  <p>Uncertain steps, but courage grows,</p>

  <p>The path is wide, and no one knows.</p>

    
  <p>Deadlines chase, the nights are long,</p>

  <p>But still you fight, still you belong.</p>

  <p>Each choice you make, each road you take,</p>

  <p>Builds the person you’ll awake.</p>

    
  <p>It’s not just books, it’s not just tests,</p>

  <p>It’s finding out what fuels your chest.</p>

  <p>So walk with pride, don’t hide your flame,</p>

  <p>This stage of life won’t come again.</p>

    
  <p>For every fall, you’ll rise once more,</p>
    
  <p>Each stumble leads to something sure.</p>
    <sub>About the Poem</sub>

    <p>This poem celebrates the journey of student life – full of new beginnings, challenges, and discoveries. It reminds us that college is more than just books and exams; it’s about courage, resilience, and finding what truly fuels our passions. With every stumble and every rise, we grow into stronger, wiser versions of ourselves.

      It is an inspiring reflection for students to embrace this stage with pride, knowing that each moment contributes to the story they are building.</p>

  <h2>Short Story: The Forgotten Assignment</h2>
  <sub>by Ayanda Cass (Stydent at Rosebank Collage)</sub>
  <p>It was 10 minutes before class when Sipho realized he had forgotten to finish his essay.</p>
  <p>Panic struck like thunder.</p>
  <p>He opened his laptop, typed furiously, and prayed that his brain would magically produce 1,000 words.</p>
  <p>His roommate, Thandi, walked in, calmly sipping coffee.</p>
  <p>“Why do you look like a chicken chased by thunder?” she asked.</p>
  <p>“My essay! It’s due in ten minutes!” Sipho groaned.</p>
  <p>Thandi raised an eyebrow. “Didn’t you say yesterday that future-you would handle it?”</p>
  <p>Sipho buried his face in his hands. “Future-me is an idiot!”</p>
  <p>In a burst of desperation, he typed the title: ‘The Importance of Time Management.’</p>
  <p>By the time he submitted it, the essay was barely 300 words long—but it was the most passionate writing he’d ever done.</p>
  <p>Later that day, the lecturer smiled and said,</p>
  <p>“This essay was short, but powerful. You’ve captured the struggles of every student in this room.”</p>
  <p>Sipho couldn’t believe it. His disaster had turned into a success.</p>
  <p>From that day on, he swore he’d never procrastinate again…</p>
  <p>(at least not until the next assignment).</p>
